# Introduction
The goal of lab 4 was to learn to employ mutation testing and learn how to use Selenium for GUI testing

This was done through the use of the same testing suite as in lab 3

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
Mutant 1
In the segment of the Range constructor where an exception is thrown because the lower value > higher value (lines 91-92), several mutations are created by removing calls to String functions, such as append() and  toString().  These mutations were killed by adding a test where the exception message is checked
Mutant 2
In the part of the Range constructor where lower and higher values are set (lines 95-96), several mutations are created by incrementing the local input variables lower and upper after they are used.  These are equivalent mutants because these local variables go out of scope and are discarded immediately after.  Therefore, these mutants were not killed. 
Mutant 3
In the part of the Range constructor where an IllegalArgumentException is thrown, a mutant is created by removing this line entirely(line 93).  This mutant is killed by using invalid inputs (lower > upper) and asserting that an exception is thrown 
Mutation 4: line #147
Mutation was: Incremented (a++) double field lower → SURVIVED on the method getCentralValue.
This mutation survives since we don’t have tests that check if lower or upper bounds change in the getCentralValue() method. The increment is applied after lower is used, and therefore does not affect the output of the method, but changes the lower private variable in the class by one.
return this.lower / 2.0 + this.upper / 2.0;

Mutation 5: line #147
Mutation was: Incremented (++a) double field lower → KILLED on the method getCentralValue.
This mutation is KILLED since the increment happens before the value lower is used for computing the centralValue, causing the output to change. This mutant however would also increment the private variable lower if it was not killed.  
return this.lower / 2.0 + this.upper / 2.0;

Mutation 6: line #147
Mutation was: Decremented (a--) double field upper → SURVIVED on the method getCentralValue.
This mutation survives since we don’t have tests that check if lower or upper bounds change in the getCentralValue() method. The decrement is applied after lower is used, and therefore does not affect the output of the method, but changes the lower private variable in the class by one.
return this.lower / 2.0 + this.upper / 2.0;

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes
Based on the mutation scores of Range at 52% it can be observed that the testing of the class is not the greatest.
# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy
Mutants that don't affect the functionality of the code are called equivalent mutants. Despite having no impact on the code's overall behavior, equivalent mutants can falsely suggest a fault in the code, leading to inaccurate results. Due to the presence of these mutants, achieving 100% mutation coverage becomes nearly impossible. Therefore, equivalent mutants negatively affect the accuracy of the mutation score in a tested program.

To detect equivalent mutants section you can write how we could code in equivalent mutants that are common, such as a changing a < to a != in a for loop, and have the program detect them.
Basically hard code in a list of common mutants to ignore as equivalent.

We examined the PITEST summary of the files to identify equivalent mutations. Since equivalent mutations imitate the correct functionality of the program, they cannot be killed. Therefore, we scrutinized all surviving mutations and checked their conditions for equivalence. To verify the similarity of these conditions, we manually altered the code and tested its functionality. We restored the original code after testing for consistency.
# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
We found that the majority of mutants that weren't killed that could have been resulted from using variables in our assert statements and not constant literals. Another big fault was actually still having faults in our test suite
# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
We need mutation testing to check boundary values and to ensure that the test cases written by software engineers are reliable. Using differing metrics is important in determining the effect of a test suite. An adavantage of mutant testing is a more robust test suite without having to write more tests. The main disadvantage of mutant testing is equivalent mutants which lower the mutant score whie not being able to be killed

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints
In Add to Cart and Remove from Cart assertions were used to check that the text matched and that the item was actually added or removed from the cart
Same for add and remove from wishlist

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data
For Add to Cart and Remove from Cart different test data was not used as it required clicking on different points of the screen and could not change data
# Discuss advantages and disadvantages of Selenium vs. Sikulix
Advantages of Sikuli:

Image-based automation: Sikuli allows you to automate applications by using images instead of relying on traditional locator-based strategies, which can make automation easier and more flexible.
Cross-platform support: Sikuli is platform-independent and can be used to automate applications across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Easy to learn: Sikuli is easy to learn and use, even for those without programming experience, thanks to its visual scripting capabilities.
Integration with other automation tools: Sikuli can be used in conjunction with other automation tools, such as Selenium, to create powerful automation scripts.

Disadvantages of Sikuli:

Relies on screen coordinates: Sikuli relies on screen coordinates, which can be problematic if the application being automated changes its layout or resolution.
Limited browser automation: Sikuli is not optimized for browser automation and may not work as well as other tools like Selenium for automating web applications.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed
For the mutation testing portion of the lab each team member worked on the test cases they were most familiar with.

For the GUI testing portion each person completed 2 different tests on their own

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned
The main difficulty encountered in the lab was learning how to perform the mutation testing and gui testing

Another main difficulty was actually performing the mutation testing as it would often not work properly
# Comments/feedback on the lab itself
The lab was good and fun! It was very usefull to learn mutation and gui testing
